# History of Industrial Design
**A summary of concepts from the RISD course by Matthew Bird**

> [!NOTE]
> This document summarizes the key concepts from Matthew Bird's "History of Industrial Design" video series (Rhode Island School of Design). It is organized chronologically and thematically to mirror the course structure.

## Week 1: Introduction & Foundations
**Goal:** Define Industrial Design and explore its pre-industrial roots.

### What is Industrial Design?
Industrial Design (ID) is often defined as the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer.
*   **Key Insight:** ID didn't just "appear" with the Industrial Revolution; it evolved from centuries of "making."
*   **The "Wage Motive":** Unlike diverse craft production, industrial production is often driven by the need to sell mass quantities to pay wages (the wage motive), necessitating standardization.

### Ancient Engineering & Royal Patronage
Before mass manufacturing, design was driven by **Royal Patronage**. Kings and Queens set the taste, and craftsmen worked to please a single, wealthy client.
*   **Pre-Industrial "Factories":** Large-scale production existed (e.g., Roman terra sigillata pottery), but it was powered by human/animal labor, not steam.
*   **Josiah Wedgwood (1730–1795):** A pivotal figure who bridged the gap between craft and industry. He used molds to mass-produce pottery ("Creamware" or "Queen's Ware") that looked hand-crafted but was affordable for the growing middle class. He introduced modern marketing (showrooms, money-back guarantees).

## Week 2: The American System of Manufacturing
**Goal:** understand how the US changed production through interchangeability.

### Interchangeable Parts
*   **Eli Whitney & The Armory Practice:** Initially famed for the Cotton Gin, Whitney is more critical to ID for promoting **interchangeable parts** in gun manufacturing (though he faked his initial demo!).
*   **The System:** Instead of fitting parts A to B individually (craft), parts are made to a high tolerance so any Part A fits any Part B. This allowed for **repairability** and **mass assembly**.
*   **Mechanization:** The shift from hand tools to machine tools (lathes, milling machines) that could hold these tolerances.

---

## Week 3: The Industrial Revolution
**Goal:** The explosion of power and production in the 19th Century.

### The Great Exhibition of 1851 (The Crystal Palace)
Held in London, this was the first World's Fair. It showcased the industrial might of the British Empire.
*   **The Building:** Designed by **Joseph Paxton**, a greenhouse builder. It was a marvel of pre-fabricated iron and glass—essentially an industrial product itself, assembled rapidly on-site.
*   **The Contrast:** Inside this high-tech building, most exhibits were backward-looking "ornamental" craft objects. This clash highlighted the need for a new design language suited to machines.

**Reference Artifacts:**

### The Thonet Chair (No. 14)
*   Michael Thonet perfected **steam-bending wood**.
*   **No. 14 Chair (1859):** The ultimate industrial product. It consisted of only 6 parts + screws. It could be shipped "flat pack" (36 chairs in one cubic meter box) and assembled at the destination. It was cheap, durable, and ubiquitous.

## Week 4 & 5: Reactions & The Birth of Style
**Goal:** How designers reacted to the ugliness of early machine-made goods.

### The Arts & Crafts Movement (c. 1880–1920)
*   **William Morris:** Rejected the "soulless" machine. He advocated for a return to honest craftsmanship, truth to materials, and the joy of labor. Ironically, his handcrafted goods were too expensive for the masses he wanted to help.

### Art Nouveau (c. 1890–1910)
*   **Nature as Inspiration:** A "total art" style (architecture, furniture, graphics) characterized by organic, flowing lines and "whiplash" curves.
*   **Key Figures:** Louis Comfort Tiffany (lamps), Hector Guimard (Paris Metro entrances). It was a bridge to modernism but still very ornamental.

*Tiffany Lamp: distinct organic forms.*

### Art Deco & Streamlining (c. 1920s–1930s)
*   **Speed & Geometry:** Influenced by King Tut's tomb discovery and the Machine Age. It features geometric shapes, symmetry, and expensive materials (chrome, lacquer).
*   **Streamlining:** The science of hydrodynamics (teardrop shapes) applied to static objects (staplers, pencil sharpeners) to make them look "fast" and modern.
*   **Raymond Loewy:** The father of streamlining. "MAYA" (Most Advanced Yet Acceptable). Designed the PRR S1 locomotive, the Coke bottle redesign, and the Lucky Strike logo.

## Week 6 & 7: Modernism & The Bauhaus
**Goal:** Form follows function.

### Scientific Management (Taylorism)
*   **Frederick Winslow Taylor:** Analyzed workflows to improve efficiency (Time and Motion studies).
*   **The Kitchen:** This logic was applied to the home (e.g., the "Frankfurt Kitchen"), optimizing the layout for the "housewife engineer."

### The Bauhaus (1919–1933)
*   **The School:** Founded by **Walter Gropius** in Germany. It merged the Art Academy and the Crafts School.
*   **Philosophy:** "Form Follows Function." Rejecting ornament. Designing for mass production using industrial materials (tubular steel, glass, concrete).
*   **Marcel Breuer:** Inspired by bicycle handlebars, he created the **Wassily Chair** (Model B3) using bent tubular steel.

## Week 8 & 9: The Profession & Evolution
**Goal:** ID becomes a recognized career.

### Henry Dreyfuss & Human Factors
*   **Designing for People:** Dreyfuss brought scientific rigor to ID. He focused on **Ergonomics** (Human Factors).
*   **Joe & Josephine:** He compiled data on human measurements to create these statistical archetypes, ensuring his designs (telephones, thermostats, tractors) fit the human body.
*   **Model 302 Telephone:** The classic heavy black desk phone.

### Mid-Century Modern: Plywood
*   **The Eameses (Charles & Ray):** Experimented with molding plywood into complex curves (originally for leg splints in WWII).
*   **LCW (Lounge Chair Wood):** A masterpiece of comfortable, mass-producible furniture.

## Week 10, 11, 12: Corporate Efficiency, Plastics & Simulation
**Goal:** The post-war boom and the digital age.

### The Corporate Takeover
*   **Herman Miller Action Office:** Designed by **Robert Propst**. Intended to be flexible and liberate the worker, it was co-opted by management to create the "Art of the Cubicle" (stuffing as many people as possible into a grid).
*   **Braun & Dieter Rams:** "Less but better." The sleek, minimalist aesthetic (e.g., SK4 "Snow White's Coffin") that heavily influenced Jony Ive at Apple.

*Braun SK4: Minimalist Hi-Fi.*

### Plastics!
*   **Tupperware:** **Earl Tupper** invented the material/seal, but **Brownie Wise** invented the marketing (The Tupperware Party). It brought plastics into the respectable home.
*   **The downside:** The era of disposability and environmental impact.

### Conclusion & The Digital Age
*   **Apple:** The iMac G3 (1998) brought color and translucency back, signaling that computers were for *people*, not just businesses.
*   **Celebrity Design:** The elevation of the "Star Designer" (Philippe Starck, Marc Newson).
*   **The Future:** Design is now about systems, services, and sustainability, not just physical objects.
